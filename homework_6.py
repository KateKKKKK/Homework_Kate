# 1. Write an arithmetic function that takes 3 arguments: the first 2 are numbers,
# and the third is the operation to be performed on them. If the third argument is +, add them up; if -,
# then subtract; * - multiply; / - divide (first to second). Otherwise, return the string
# Not known operation: {operation}. Describe the function in the attached file in such a way
# that all checks in the __main__ task_1 block are performed correctly.
# DO NOT CALL THE FUNCTION YOURSELF I HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS IN "assert" STATEMENTS

# def third_operations(num_1, num_2, operation):
#     if operation == "+":
#         return num_1 + num_2
#     elif operation == "-":
#         return num_1 - num_2
#     elif operation == "/":
#         return num_1 / num_2
#     elif operation == "*":
#         return num_1 * num_2
#     else:
#         print(f"Not known operation: {operation}")
